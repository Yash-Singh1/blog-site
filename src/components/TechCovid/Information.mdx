# Covid-19 Technology Advancements

Over Covid-19, most people stayed home, which meant boredom. And when boredom falls us, the average person
(thats probably a lie, 99% of us) turned to our screens in some way or the other. Now that means problem for
some industries like the tourism industry, but when it came to the tech industry, it was more of a boom.

The goal of this infographic is to explain what advancements made to the technology industry over this approximately
two years period.

## Digitalization

Many processes that were originally done on paper or physically is now done online. People have also changed their
daily routine or habits to take more screen time and learned many new things about the digital world.

## Gaming Trends

This was an interesting change that happened over the Covid-19 Era. People started off on the first 6 months or so
gaming on a wide ranges of devices, such as mobile and desktop. However, as lockdown started getting stricter and
we went deeper into the year of 2020, people started turning to higher screen size games, such as console/PC games.
This was obviously because they when they realized that they would have to live like this for almost another year,
they started searching for higher HD quality. This pattern change made the mobile gaming industry's popularity
drop.

## Triple Amount of New Software Developers

Many people took advantage of the large amount of free time given to them over the Covid-19 Era to switch careers
and become a developer or just learn it as a hobbyist. The StackOverflow Developer Survey showed a Ã—3 increase
in the amount of developers with under 5 years of experience between 2020 and 2021.

## Rich got richer; Poor got poorer

I didn't include this in the infographic, because it is more of a finance topic, but related to the tech industry.
In the year of 2019, the richest person was Jeff Bezos, with a net worth of $131 billion. As of the writing of this
article, the richest person in the world is Elon Musk, with a net worth of $286 billion. The cause of this almost
double in their net worth was all due to the stock increase in the technology industry.
