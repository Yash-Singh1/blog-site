# Hacking Cookie Clicker

In this article I will share a little piece of code that took over Cookie Clicker
from sugar lumps, to cookies, to upgrades. It does everything.

## What is Cookie Clicker?

[Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) is an idle game that
allows you to buy buildings and upgrades that will make cookies for you. You can
also click on the large displayed cookie to get more. The buildings increase your
CPS (Cookies per second) to speed up cookie production. The game adds in much
more, such as sugar lumps, milk, and dragons that is there to explore.

## About Hacking Cookie Clicker

There are multiple ways to hack cookie clicker that were made before.
Most people, are unaware of `Infinity` being present in Javascript and run
something like:

```js
Game.Earn(999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999);
```

Cookie Clicker even offers its own DevTools with buttons to multiply and control
the game. Another alternative to hacking would also be to do:

```js
Game.RuinTheFun();
```

This is a function that just gives you lots and lots of cookies and
CPS (Cookies Per Second). However, this spawns some Cookie Swallowers called
wrinklers that have to be clicked to be removed. Of course it is possible to
write a script that would remove them:

```js
delete Game.wrinklers;
```

Some things that the Ruin The Fun hack has that mine doesn't is dragons and some
squid. However, it doesn't increase your milk, CPS, and cookies to max. All
three of the pieces of code combined could make a winning game.

## Code

Straight up, here is the code:

```js
Game.cookies = Infinity;
Game.lumps = Infinity;
function doEverything() {
  Game.ObjectsById.forEach((obj) => {
    obj.buy(10000);
    Game.cookies = Infinity;
  });
  document.querySelectorAll('#upgrades > div').forEach((div) => div.click());
  Game.cookiesPs = Infinity;
  Game.ObjectsById[0].levelUp();
  setTimeout(() => doEverything(), 1000);
}
doEverything();
```

First of all, it will earn `Infinity` cookies and sugar lumps, followed with a
recursive function that will buy every item 10000 times, reearn the money, and
then buy all the upgrades. Lastly, the level is leveled up using the sugar lumps.
Using this code, it didn't take long to reach the highest milk level and finish
the game with the `Infinity` cookie.

## Save

If instead of writing in the code, you want the save code, here it is:
