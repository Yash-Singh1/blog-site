# Path to Programming for Kids

Today is a day filled with technology. Everywhere around us, we use it. On our
PCs, cell phones, IPads, etc. However when it comes to building apps
for them, not everyone knows how to do that.

## What is programming?

Programming is giving a computer a set of instructions to follow and perform.

## Getting Started

The best place to get started depends on the path you want to take.

### Web Developer

For those who want to become a web developer, the best option should
be to read [Javascript for Kids](https://www.google.com/books/edition/JavaScript_for_Kids/71nDBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0).

It is a simple book that gives an introduction to Javascript.

After that, start learning some `nodejs` and `npm`.

### Game Developer

Game development is a growing industry. Due to coronavirus, Unity and Roblox has
seen its boom in the year of 2020. Depending on where you want to release your game,
the following two are some options:

#### Unity

Unity allows you to release your game to a variety of platforms and
write them in C#. However, getting assets such as sound, scripts,
textures, etc. is a bit difficult. It is also not too
much beginner-friendly in my opinion. Here are some learning
resources:

- Installation: <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingUnity.html>
- <https://learn.unity.com/>
- The tutorials inside the Unity Hub

#### Roblox Studio

Roblox Studio allows you to write in Lua, a much simpler language.
Getting assets is not too difficult in the platform, however
it only allows you to release to Roblox, meaning you can't
make a seperate website, app, etc. for playing your game.
However, it makes it much easier to release, because
you just need to push your game to Roblox, instead of others.
The only problem is that Roblox Studio doesn't have too
many resources to get started with it. Here are a few:

- About: <https://www.roblox.com/create>
- <https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/>
- Introduction: <https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-roblox-lua-start-making-games-with-roblox-studio/>
- Udemy Courses: <https://www.udemy.com/user/brendonross/>

## Learning Git

Once you have a good idea, with your field, I suggest that you learn Git, and
contribute to open source. Here is a book: <http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>.
