# Importing Variables

A while back I had installed a submodule inside one
of my repositories: [`Yash-Singh1/npm-expansions-randomgen`](https://github.com/Yash-Singh1/npm-expansions-randomgen).
The submodules contained lists of all the words of a part of speech. However,
it was a gist and the variables weren't exported. This article shows a workaround
using `eval{:js}` that solves the problem.

## Eval

Before I introduce the workaround, let me introduce `eval{:js}`. `eval{:js}` is a function
that allows to run the code provided as a string inside the arguments. For example:

```js
eval('console.log("hello world")');
```

Would run:

```js
console.log('hello world');
```

Another thing to keep in mind is that `eval{:js}` is unsafe and not allowed to be
used everywhere.

## Importing Unexported Variables

To import a variable `VAR` from a file `FILE`, run:

```js
eval('(()=>{' + fs.readFileSync(FILE, 'utf8') + ';return ' + VAR + ';})()');
```

This would have a function that runs the contents of the file and returns the
string `VAR` that is the variable. This function is then run inside `eval{:js}`.

Here is an example in my [code](https://github.com/Yash-Singh1/npm-expansions-randomgen/blob/main/generate.js#L19).
