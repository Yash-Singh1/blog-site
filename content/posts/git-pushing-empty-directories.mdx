# Pushing Empty Directories in Git

A while back some of my tests started [failing](https://github.com/Yash-Singh1/node-dedupredup/runs/2788648173)
for no reason. It seemed that one of my empty directories didn't exist.
The file explorer in the GitHub UI even showed this. Git
doesn't push empty directories to your repository. However, there are ways
to get past this.

## Adding a `.gitignore`

One apparent solution might be to just create a `.gitignore` with the following content:

```text
.gitignore
```

This didn't seem to work, because Git again recognized that the directory is empty.

## Adding a `.keep`

What I did was I added a [`.keep` file in that directory](https://github.com/Yash-Singh1/node-dedupredup/blob/main/test/output10/bthings/.keep).
This made sure that the directory is pushed to Git. Unfortunately, that did make
my tests fail, because that file wasn't expected.

The solution was to remove all `.keep` files before starting the test and readding
them after the test.

## Hooks in Tests

To remove and readd `.keep` files there is usually some system or way to define
hooks inside a test. In QUnit (the testing framework I was using), it is:

```js
QUnit.module('test group', {
  before() {
    // Stuff before this test group runs
  },
  after() {
    // Stuff after this test group runs
  }
  // ...
});
```
