# Function vs eval

While working with `eval` to do some hacky workarounds in build configuration, I was curious about the difference between `eval` and `Function`. Here is what I found.

## Difference

Quoting from [`tc39/proposal-hashbang`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-hashbang#does-the-hashbang-syntax-work-within-eval--function):

> Hashbang comments are only avilable at the start of a [`Script`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-Script) or [`Module`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-Module) parsing goal. Since `eval` uses `Script` it does support Hashbang comments. Since `Function` uses [`FunctionBody`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-FunctionBody), it does not.

`eval` would execute the JavaScript code in the context of a module/script, while `Function` would execute it in the context of a function.

This means that `Function` would disallow hashbang comments, but allow the use of `await` (unless using top-level await, then available in `Script` also), and `return`.

For making use of generators and async functions, there are seperate constructors for them:

- `GeneratorFunction` for generators
- `AsyncFunction` for async functions
- `AsyncGeneratorFunction` for both

According to MDN, the `Function` constructor also contains less security risks compared to `eval`.
