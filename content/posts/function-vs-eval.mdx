# Function vs eval

While working with `eval{:.variable.other.constant}` to do some hacky workarounds in build configuration, I was curious about the difference between `eval{:.variable.other.constant}` and `Function{:.variable.other.constant}`. Here is what I found.

## Difference

Quoting from [`tc39/proposal-hashbang`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-hashbang#does-the-hashbang-syntax-work-within-eval--function):

> Hashbang comments are only avilable at the start of a [`Script`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-Script) or [`Module`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-Module) parsing goal. Since `eval{:.variable.other.constant}` uses `Script` it does support Hashbang comments. Since `Function{:.variable.other.constant}` uses [`FunctionBody`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-FunctionBody), it does not.

`eval{:.variable.other.constant}` would execute the JavaScript code in the context of a module/script, while `Function{:.variable.other.constant}` would execute it in the context of a function.

This means that `Function{:.variable.other.constant}` would disallow hashbang comments, but allow the use of `await{:js}` (unless using top-level await, then available in `Script` also), and `return{:js}`.

For making use of generators and async functions, there are seperate constructors for them:

- `GeneratorFunction{:.variable.other.constant}` for generators
- `AsyncFunction{:.variable.other.constant}` for async functions
- `AsyncGeneratorFunction{:.variable.other.constant}` for both

According to MDN, the `Function{:.variable.other.constant}` constructor also contains less security risks compared to `eval{:.variable.other.constant}`.
