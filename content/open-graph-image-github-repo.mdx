# Using Open Graph Images as an Alternative to `github-readme-stats`

In this article, I will show you how to use GitHub's Open Graph Images to
create a card for your repository. It is a pretty cool and lightweight
feature when you don't want to use something more advanced like
`github-readme-stats` (or if `github-readme-stats` banned you).

## What is Open Graph Images?

Have you ever pasted a link into a message bar and gotten a pretty neat preview
of the page with an image, title, description, and text?

That is through a specification called Open Graph that specifies the format for `og:*`
metadata that can be detected by social networks or chatting platforms like Discord
and Google Chat.

## What is the format for GitHub?

Here is the format:

```text
https://opengraph.githubassets.com/1/<owner>/<repo>
```

Here is it in HTML:

```html
<img src="https://opengraph.githubassets.com/1/<owner>/<repo>" />
```
