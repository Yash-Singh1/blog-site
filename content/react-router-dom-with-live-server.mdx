# React Router DOM with `live-server`

In one of my projects I was using React Router DOM and hosting my site using `live-server`.

However the problem was that even though I was able to click, for example a link
to an about page, I couldn't open it manually at the route `/about`.

It would display the following message:

```text
Cannot GET /about
```

## Why?

Let's start with why this message is appearing. `live-server` gets a request at `/about`
and looks for a `about.html` in the `dist/` directory, but it doesn't find one, giving
back this message. `react-router-dom` works with the idea that all paths will return
the source code for `index.html` and it would just read the path requested and display
the respective component.

## Fixing it

The solution would be to use the `--entry-file` option inside the CLI.

Here is the documentation on it:

> serve this file (server root relative) in place of
> missing files (useful for single page apps)

This would just return the contents of the file specified whenever a 404
has to be returned. Here is how to use it with `live-server`:

```sh
live-server dist --entry-file=index.html
```
